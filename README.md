## Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This repository shares the learning process of the course CS221 in fall 2019 with online materials from Stanford University. The results are divided into the following two parts:

1. Lecture and reading notes, some with summaries titled *Thinking*

   - Additional notes of models for sequence problems are taken from CS224n with more details.

2. Assignments' solutions

   - Solution codes are in Jupyter Notebooks and related Python files and are marked as below:

     ```python
     # *****START OF YOUR CODE (DO NOT DELETE/MODIFY THIS LINE)*****
     """
     code
     """
     # *****END OF YOUR CODE (DO NOT DELETE/MODIFY THIS LINE)*****
     ```
   
   - A Jupyter Notebook file `Note.ipynb` recorded some details during the assignments.
